        UK Ghost Stories is not your typical podcast. We love to tell stories, those kinds of stories that suit being told around a campfire, in the middle of a forest in the middle of summer. As well as telling stories, we love to share our thoughts and theories on those stories.<br /><br />
        Our stories range from ghosts to demons, angels to aliens, monsters and myths, time travel, parallel universes and other dimensions, spirituality and conspiracy theories and many more. If you can think of a topic that is not usually “dinner table” conversation, chances are it’s something we’d love to talk about!<br /><br />
        Our variety of hosts bring multiple levels to the podcast, each chapter is unique and focuses on certain topics such as Urbex Ghost Stories, Folklore, Crystals and Reincarnation and many more whilst easily branching into other topics.<br /><br />
        UK Ghost Stories is a very down-to-earth podcast, we are open with our listeners about the running of the show, our thoughts and feelings and we encourage our listeners to do the same. Compared to other podcasts, we are very unorthodox in the sense that we are not a highly polished, well rehearsed and well edited podcast, we are...simply...us.<br /><br />
